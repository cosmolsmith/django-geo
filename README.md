Initial work on django-geo project.

Useful stuff for geolocation apps.

(Much simpler than the contrib geo stuff)

## Fixtures

django-geo comes with 3 fixtures. These are optimized for use with
A Place for Rover, but should be usable in the general case.

- production_data
This fixture contains every zip code in the US and related information.
- development_data
This fixture contains every zip code in Washington state
- test_data
This fixture contains a very limited set of zip codes in the Seattle area.
